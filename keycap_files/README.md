# Keycap File Notes

I started with a [smoother keycap]("STL_files/keycap_1.STL) design, thinking I'd like it more.  It works well, but I felt like I wanted something that matched the XDA profile of the other keycaps.  So I [approximated]("STL_files/keycap_XDA_approximation.STL") a 1.5u XDA profile.  It's not super great, but it's a little closer.  The main difference is that it has straight sides rather than side that curve in. In other words, I was lazy and used a drafted extrude rather than a guided loft.
