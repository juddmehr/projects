# Fancy Case Notes

This is the first case I made. I've included the original [CAD (SolidWorks) files](CAD_files), the files I used for [laser cutting](laser_cutter_files), and the file I used to 3D print the ["plugs"](3Dprint_files/plug.STL) for my standoffs to work with the 4mm PCB holes.

Note that I didn't actually laser cut the plates on mine. I actually CNC milled them.  That being said, it's much better to laser cut them, so I've only included those files. (The CNC CAD is very similar, but slightly adjusted to account for the fact that you can't cut square easily.)
