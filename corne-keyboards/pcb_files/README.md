# PCB File Notes

Production_Files.zip are the exact files I sent to [https://jlcpcb.com/](https://jlcpcb.com/) for manufacture.  I changed almost nothing from [foostan's files](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/tree/main/corne-cherry/pcb) except the [front silks](modified_files_from_foostan/svg/corne-cherry-F_SilkS.pdf).  I've also included here the files I modified from the [original corne-cherry files](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/tree/main/corne-cherry/pcb).

NOTE: I had to 3D print ["plugs"]() in order to get my standoffs to work the way I wanted.  If I were to redo things, I'd change the holes to be 2.4mm diamter to work with the screws and standoffs I used (i.e., make the 5 support holes the same size as the 2 holes for the OLED cover).  In the official [build guide](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/blob/main/corne-cherry/doc/v3/buildguide_en.md), it is recomended to use spacers, but I wanted a slightly more secure solution.
