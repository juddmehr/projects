# 3D Printed Case Notes

After making the ["fancy"](../fancy_case/) case, I decided that I'd try a 3D printed one (mostly because I didn't want to machine another set of plates if possible, even though I already had enough of all the other parts to make 2 cases.) I based my design off of [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3652379), but did all the CAD from scratch based on my fancy case design.

After a few tries, I ended up with the files in this directory.

In addition to a case, I also designed a "case case". That is to say a case for the cases that I could toss in a bag and not worry about breaking anything.  I was strongly inspired by [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4229965), but again, did all the CAD from scratch to make sure everything fit just how I wanted.
