# 3D Printed Case Notes

After making the "fancy" case, I decided that I'd try a 3D printed one (mostly because I didn't want to machine another set of plates if possible, even though I already had enough of all the other parts to make 2 cases.)

After a few tries, I ended up with the files here.

In addition to a case, I also designed a "case case". That is to say a case for the cases that I could toss in a bag and not worry about breaking anything.
