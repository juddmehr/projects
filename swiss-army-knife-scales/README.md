# Swiss Army Knife Scales

<img src="unfolded.jpg" alt="unfolded" width="400"/>

These are custom brass scales (the outer pieces holding all the bits together) for a Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD Pocket Knife.

Everything is held together with M1.6 screws rather than the original press-fit rivets for ease of dis/re-assembly.
